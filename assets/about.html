	<p class= "whitetxt">I go to a school named Southwest Career and Technical Academy. I started going here in my 9th grade and it was probably the best choice I have made in my life. Video production was a program I took at this school from day one and I am on track to take it all 4 years. Web design is my program area and that is something I enjoy as well. I have met lifelong friends here and overall it is just a very good school.</p>
