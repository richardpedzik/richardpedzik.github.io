	<p class="intro"><strong>Hello and welcome to my portfolio!</strong> My name is Richard Pedzik and I attend the school Southwest Career and Technical academy. I have many hobbies ranging from videography to music production. I have a history of both from being a producer of news stories and features for my news program at my school. I don't find web design as intriguing as video production, but shown from this website I do still enjoy it. As mentioned before I have a history in music production. I have produced 14-15 songs (Depending on release dates the exact number is up for interpretation) and I am currently in a friendly Hip-Hop group that promotes Earth, Body, and Environmental health. I wont release the name or link to this group due to several issues I have had and are ongoing right now due to the lyric choice my group tends to use. Those are my 2 favorite hobbies but I also have many more! Explore this website I made in only about a week to learn about who I am as an artist, producer, and human being.
